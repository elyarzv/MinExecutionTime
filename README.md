# MinExecutionTime
A time optimal trajectory planning will be achieved for 2 robots working together to pick and place parts.

This repository will contain the codes and descriptions of an approach to pick and place where joints follow a Synchronized Trigonometric S‚Äêcurve Trajectory
(STST) to achieve a time optimal trajectory.
